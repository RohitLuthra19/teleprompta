# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Dynamic Form Component is a reusable, schema-based form component for React Native applications that renders dynamic forms based on JSON schemas. The component will integrate with Gluestack v3 UI components and support state management through Zustand/MobX. It provides comprehensive validation, conditional rendering, dynamic option loading, and external control capabilities to enable developers to create complex forms declaratively without writing custom form code for each use case.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to render forms dynamically from a JSON schema, so that I can create complex forms without writing custom form components for each use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid JSON schema is provided THEN the system SHALL render all form fields according to the schema structure
2. WHEN the schema contains nested objects THEN the system SHALL render nested form sections appropriately
3. WHEN the schema contains arrays THEN the system SHALL support dynamic addition and removal of array items
4. IF the schema is invalid or malformed THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. WHEN the schema changes THEN the system SHALL re-render the form to match the new schema

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to support all common field types, so that I can create comprehensive forms that handle various data input requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the schema specifies a text field THEN the system SHALL render a text input using Gluestack v3 components
2. WHEN the schema specifies a dropdown field THEN the system SHALL render a select component with provided options
3. WHEN the schema specifies a date picker field THEN the system SHALL render a date picker component
4. WHEN the schema specifies a switch field THEN the system SHALL render a toggle switch component
5. WHEN the schema specifies a radio field THEN the system SHALL render radio button options
6. WHEN the schema specifies a checkbox field THEN the system SHALL render checkbox components
7. WHEN the schema specifies a number field THEN the system SHALL render a numeric input with appropriate keyboard
8. WHEN the schema specifies a textarea field THEN the system SHALL render a multi-line text input

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want schema-driven validation, so that I can ensure data integrity without writing custom validation logic for each field.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a field is marked as required in the schema THEN the system SHALL validate that the field is not empty before submission
2. WHEN a field has regex validation in the schema THEN the system SHALL validate the input against the provided pattern
3. WHEN a field has custom validation rules in the schema THEN the system SHALL execute the custom validation function
4. WHEN a field has async validation in the schema THEN the system SHALL handle asynchronous validation with loading states
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages near the relevant fields
6. WHEN all validations pass THEN the system SHALL allow form submission
7. WHEN validation occurs THEN the system SHALL provide real-time feedback during user input

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want event handling capabilities, so that I can respond to form interactions and implement custom business logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the form is submitted THEN the system SHALL trigger the onSubmit callback with form data
2. WHEN the form is reset THEN the system SHALL trigger the onReset callback and clear all field values
3. WHEN field values change THEN the system SHALL trigger onChange callbacks with updated values
4. WHEN the form mounts THEN the system SHALL trigger onMount lifecycle hook if provided
5. WHEN the form unmounts THEN the system SHALL trigger onUnmount lifecycle hook if provided
6. WHEN validation state changes THEN the system SHALL trigger onValidationChange callback with validation status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want conditional rendering support, so that I can show or hide fields based on other field values or external conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a field has conditional visibility rules THEN the system SHALL show or hide the field based on specified conditions
2. WHEN conditional logic depends on other field values THEN the system SHALL re-evaluate visibility when those values change
3. WHEN conditional logic depends on external state THEN the system SHALL re-evaluate visibility when external state changes
4. WHEN a conditionally hidden field has a value THEN the system SHALL exclude that value from form submission
5. WHEN a conditionally shown field becomes visible THEN the system SHALL apply default values if specified

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want dynamic option loading for dropdown and select fields, so that I can populate options from APIs or external data sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a dropdown field specifies dynamic options THEN the system SHALL load options from the provided data source
2. WHEN dynamic options are loading THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
3. WHEN dynamic option loading fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and retry option
4. WHEN dynamic options depend on other field values THEN the system SHALL reload options when dependencies change
5. WHEN dynamic options are successfully loaded THEN the system SHALL populate the dropdown with the new options

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Zustand/MobX integration, so that I can manage form state within my application's state management system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Zustand integration THEN the system SHALL sync form values with the specified Zustand store
2. WHEN using MobX integration THEN the system SHALL sync form values with the specified MobX observable
3. WHEN external state changes THEN the system SHALL update form field values accordingly
4. WHEN form field values change THEN the system SHALL update the external state store
5. WHEN the form is reset THEN the system SHALL reset values in the external state store

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want external control via refs, so that I can programmatically interact with the form from parent components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a ref is attached to the form THEN the system SHALL expose methods for programmatic control
2. WHEN the submit method is called via ref THEN the system SHALL trigger form submission programmatically
3. WHEN the reset method is called via ref THEN the system SHALL reset all form fields programmatically
4. WHEN the validate method is called via ref THEN the system SHALL trigger validation and return validation status
5. WHEN the setFieldValue method is called via ref THEN the system SHALL update the specified field value
6. WHEN the getFieldValue method is called via ref THEN the system SHALL return the current value of the specified field
