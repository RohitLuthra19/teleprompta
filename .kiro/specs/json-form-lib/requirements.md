# JSON Form Library Requirements

## Introduction

A React Native form library that generates dynamic forms from JSON schemas with advanced field components, validation, and Gluestack UI integration.

## Glossary

- **Form_Library**: The JSON-driven form generation system
- **Field_Component**: Individual input components (text, email, password, etc.)
- **Schema_Parser**: Component that converts JSON schema to form structure
- **Validation_Engine**: System that validates form inputs and displays errors
- **Gluestack_UI**: Design system used for consistent styling

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a React Native developer, I want to generate forms from JSON schemas, so that I can create dynamic forms without writing repetitive form code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid JSON schema is provided, THE Form_Library SHALL render a complete form with all specified fields
2. WHEN the schema contains field types (text, email, password, textarea, number), THE Form_Library SHALL render the appropriate Field_Component for each type
3. WHEN the schema includes validation rules, THE Form_Library SHALL apply those rules to the corresponding fields
4. WHERE the schema specifies required fields, THE Form_Library SHALL mark those fields as required with visual indicators

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user filling out a form, I want real-time validation feedback, so that I can correct errors immediately without waiting for form submission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in a field, THE Validation_Engine SHALL clear any existing errors for that field immediately
2. WHEN a user submits the form, THE Validation_Engine SHALL validate all fields and display errors for invalid fields
3. WHEN a field loses focus and contains invalid data, THE Validation_Engine SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHILE a user is typing in a field, THE Form_Library SHALL NOT display validation errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent styling across all form components, so that forms integrate seamlessly with my app's design system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any Field_Component is rendered, THE Form_Library SHALL use Gluestack_UI components for consistent styling
2. WHEN the form is displayed, THE Form_Library SHALL apply proper spacing, typography, and color schemes from Gluestack_UI
3. WHERE custom styling is needed, THE Form_Library SHALL accept style props that override default Gluestack_UI styles
4. WHEN errors are displayed, THE Form_Library SHALL use consistent error styling across all field types

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want forms to be fully accessible, so that I can use screen readers and keyboard navigation effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any field is rendered, THE Field_Component SHALL include proper accessibility labels and hints
2. WHEN errors occur, THE Form_Library SHALL announce errors to screen readers using appropriate ARIA attributes
3. WHEN navigating with keyboard, THE Form_Library SHALL provide logical tab order through all form elements
4. WHERE fields are required, THE Form_Library SHALL indicate this to assistive technologies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to handle form submission and data collection, so that I can process user input in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a valid form, THE Form_Library SHALL call the provided onSubmit callback with form data
2. WHEN form submission fails validation, THE Form_Library SHALL prevent submission and display relevant errors
3. WHEN form data changes, THE Form_Library SHALL optionally call onChange callbacks with current form state
4. WHERE form reset is triggered, THE Form_Library SHALL restore all fields to their initial values
